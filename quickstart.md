# Quickstart

### Requirements
Codice will be able to run on almost every host supporting:

- PHP 5.6.4+
- MySQL

### Installation
The fastest and recommended method, which doesn't require any advanced skills
is to download **prebuilt package** for your release of choice.

1. Get prebuilt package for the [latest stable release][releases]
2. Unpack files into desired location (and send them over FTP if needed)
3. Visit `yourdomain.com/codice/install` and follow the instructions

That's all, Codice is now up and running.

If you are, however, looking for all possible paths to get Codice installation,
including setup for development, consult [next chapter](/docs/installation).
