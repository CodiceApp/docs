Month view is the default one when you click on a *Calendar* link in top navigation bar.
Current day is marked red. When a date has an orange bar on the left, it means that
there are notes which will expire that day. When it has blue bar, at least one note
was created that day. You can click on any date to enter day view and inspect them.

<div class="alert alert-info">
When there are both notes created and expiring at given day, status indicator will
be orange.
</div>

### Day view
